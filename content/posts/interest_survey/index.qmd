Please start the semester by responding to this survey. The goal of this activity is to begin to identify personal priorities and objectives and to think critically about your immediate and short-term goals in this course in relation to your long-term plans.

## Immediate Priorities

1.  **Envisioning Your Learning Journey:**

    *Reflect on the cognitive and behavioral neuroscience concepts and knowledge areas you find most compelling. How would you like to integrate these into your coursework this semester to create a personalized learning journey?*

2.  **Research Objectives:**

    *Considering the research techniques and methodologies covered in this course, what specific research skills do you aim to develop this semester, and how do they align with your academic interests?*

3.  **Additional Aspirations:**

    *Beyond the structured curriculum, what additional personal or professional goals would you like to set for yourself this semester, and how might these enhance your experience in the field of neuroscience?*

4.  **Long-Term Vision:**

    *Can you outline your provisional 1-, 3-, and 5-year goals related to your future career? How have these goals evolved since the last time you considered them, and how do they inform your current academic trajectory?*

5.  **Instructor's Role:**

    *What specific support or resources from me, as your instructor, would be most beneficial in helping you achieve your academic and research goals this semester?*

6.  **Anticipated Challenges:**

    *What concerns or challenges do you anticipate facing next year in your endeavors, and how might you proactively address them?*

7.  **Overcoming Obstacles:**

    *Are there any particular worries you have about this upcoming semester that you would like to share, and what steps can I take to support you in overcoming these hurdles?*

Think strategically about your long-term education and research priorities, and set goals that are not only focused on immediate outcomes but also aligned with long-term academic and/or career aspirations. Moreover, these questions are an invitation for you to consider and articulate the role they would like me, as your course instructor, to play in your educational journey, fostering a collaborative learning environment for you and your classmates.

Open source analysis tools are usually a work in progress. Documentation for these tools, if present at all, will be incomplete or out of date. The purpose of this slideshow is to explore concepts that will enable team coordination on software usage and code development projects. The hope is that users will be able to find the information that they need from development notes and communication between code authors. In the long-term, notes and comments about the intended function, rationale, and usage of code will be useful for outsiders but also for the project organizers and code developers themselves."

Copying_files_between_directories with rsync You will want to go to the shared folder on HPG first and open a terminal (see button outlined green in the schreenshot below). \nThen if you copy and paste these commands into terminal it will do the work for you: rsync -av /blue/psy4911/share/ket_ephys/ket_annot /blue/psy4911/yourusername/ket_ephys/ rsync -av /blue/psy4911/share/ket_ephys/ket_annot_segs /blue/psy4911/yourusername/ket_ephys/ rsync -av /blue/psy4911/share/ket_ephys/hi-ket /blue/psy4911/yourusername/ket_ephys/\nFor the files in the hi-ket folder there’s another script (and a package named NEO ) that’s required to convert them from .plx files to .fif files.\nRequired python packages: - NEO - NEO repo - NEO documentation - MNE - MNE Tutorial: importing data from NEO\nCode for the file conversion:\nThe main thing is that it takes 15 minutes per file on hipergator (HPG) when it’s set up like a laptop computer. When you configure HPG to run your jupter notebook in high-performance mode, it takes only a minute or two per file. So, what would take 5 hours for 20 files, ends up taking only a half hour.\nAn even bigger savings comes when doing machine learning / AI with deeplabcut on HPG."
